          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the WebApps Working Group is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Haptic input devices and their emitted events and/or data.
          </li>
          <li>Data sharing across remote and local web applications.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving and acting upon data from remote sources.
          </li>
          <li>Accessing the file system and persistent storage.
          </li>
          <li>Interfacing with OS capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Integrating web applications with the OS.
          </li>
          <li>Preventing the screen from turning off under certain conditions.
          </li>
          <li>Obtaining and monitoring the location of the hosting device.
          </li>
          <li>Monitoring changes in motion and orientation of the hosting device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The working group also maintains a specification for mapping HTML
          elements and attributes to platform accessibility APIs, and a
          separate specification that defines author conformance requirements
          for setting ARIA attributes. The Working Group does not expect to add
          any other specifications relating to this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group enable
          developers to create web applications that work across a wide range
          of platforms and devices, and for a broad diversity of users, by
          addressing matters of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, privacy, and security.

                This document defines an interface definition language, Web
                IDL, that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended
                to be implemented in web browsers. Web IDL is an IDL variant
                with a number of features that allow the behavior of common
                script objects in the web platform to be specified more
                readily. How interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to
                constructs within ECMAScript execution environments is also
                detailed in this document. It is expected that this document
                acts as a guide to implementors of already-published
                specifications, and that newly published specifications
                reference this document to ensure conforming implementations of
                interfaces are interoperable.

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>Each specification must have an accompanying test suite, which is
    ideally developed in parallel to the specification. The test suite
    will be used to produce an implementation report before the
    specification transitions to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-pr">Proposed
    Recommendation</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

          The Chairs and Editors will assess support from web platform
          implementers or web application or framework developers to ensure that
          substantial changes are supported by more than a single member before
          adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, at least two web platform implementers must support a
          substantive change before it can be made to a specification. This is
          enforced by a pull request template on GitHub, which Editors must fill
          out as a public record before a substantive contribution can be
          merged. The template will require implementers to give public support
          for a change/fix/feature and, where possible, provide a link to a
          public bug tracker for an implementation.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 15 September 2020). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Web specifications that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent

            Note: Starting from 16 July 2020, the team contacts of the WebApps
            Working Group reduced from Yves Lafon (0.3 FTE), Xiaoqian Wu (0.2
            FTE) to Xiaoqian Wu (0.1 FTE). Starting from 5 November 2020,
            Marcos Cáceres re-appointed as co-chair after affiliation change.
            We made non-substantive modifications to this charter to reflect

            History of this WG
          </h3>
          <p>
            The WebApps Working Group was a predecessor to the <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a>
            (which remains active to work on specifications that are pertinent
            to the discussions relating to a collaboration agreement between
            the W3C and the WHATWG). The remaining specifications have been
            transferred from the Web Platform Working Group to the WebApps
            Working Group, so that progress can continue to be made on those
            specifications while the W3C and WHATWG negotiations are ongoing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, specifications that have been successfully incubated
            in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform
            Incubator Community Group (WICG)</a> have been transferred to the
            WebApps Working Group.
