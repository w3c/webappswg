          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the WebApps Working Group is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Haptic input devices and their emitted events and/or data.
          </li>
          <li>Textual input and text manipulation.
          </li>
          <li>Data sharing across remote and local web applications.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving and acting upon data from remote sources.
          </li>
          <li>Accessing the file system and persistent storage.
          </li>
          <li>Interfacing with OS capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Integrating web applications with the OS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The working group also maintains a specification for mapping HTML
          elements and attributes to platform accessibility APIs, and a
          separate specification that defines author conformance requirements
          for setting ARIA attributes. The Working Group does not expect to add
          any other specifications relating to this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group enable
          developers to create web applications that work across a wide range
          of platforms and devices, and for a broad diversity of users, by
          addressing matters of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, privacy, and security.

            Success Criteria
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to advance to <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title=
            "Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each
            specification must have <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at
            least two independent implementations</a> in wide use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification must have an accompanying test suite, which is
            ideally developed in parallel to the specification. The test suite
            will be used to produce an implementation report before the
            specification transitions to <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#rec-pr">Proposed
            Recommendation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where there are implications for implementors, developers, or
            users, in the areas of accessibility, internationalization,
            privacy, and security, each specification must have a section that
            describes relevant benefits, limitations, and best practice
            solutions for that particular area.

            All specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group are
            expected to progress during this charter period. The charter does
            not include a detailed timeline for each specification because such
            information is speculative and easily becomes inaccurate. However,
            a rough estimation of completion is available in the <a href=

        <p>
          To be successful, the WebApps Working Group is expected to have 10 or
          more active participants for its duration, including representatives
          from at least three key implementors. It is also expected to have
          active Editors and Test Leads for each specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to
          contribute half of a working day per week towards the WebApps Working
          Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public
          mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=
          '#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes technical contributions from non-Members, to
          be considered upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub. The
          public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chairs and Editors will ensure there is buy-in by web platform
          implementers or web application or framework developers to
          substantial changes, and not force participants to object or call for
          a formal vote when all the support for a change comes from one
          member's participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, support from two or more web platform implementers is
          required before a substantive change can be made to a specification.
          This is enforced by a pull request template on GitHub, which Editors
          must fill out as a public record before a substantive contribution
          can be merged. The template will require implementers to give public
          support for a change/fix/feature and, where possible, provide a link
          to a public bug tracker for an implementation.

          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings

          Drafts of specifications will be developed on public repositories,
          and may permit direct public contribution requests.

        <p>
          Meetings are not open to public participation, however non-members

          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
          example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation
          of the group consensus on the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the WebApps Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

            Note: Starting from 16 July 2020, the team contacts of the WebApps Working Group reduced from Yves Lafon (0.3 FTE), Xiaoqian Wu (0.2 FTE) to Xiaoqian Wu (0.1 FTE). Starting from 5 November 2020, Marcos Cáceres re-appointed as co-chair after affiliation change. We made non-substantive modifications to this charter to reflect these changes.

            History of this WG
          </h3>
          <p>
            The WebApps Working Group was a predecessor to the <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a>
            (which remains active to work on specifications that are pertinent
            to the discussions relating to a collaboration agreement between
            the W3C and the WHATWG). The remaining specifications have been
            transferred from the Web Platform Working Group to the WebApps
            Working Group, so that progress can continue to be made on those
            specifications while the W3C and WHATWG negotiations are ongoing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, specifications that have been successfully incubated
            in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform
            Incubator Community Group (WICG)</a> have been transferred to the
            WebApps Working Group.
