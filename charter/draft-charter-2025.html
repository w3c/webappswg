        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        
        <p>
          Specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group enable
          developers to create web applications that work across a wide range
          of platforms and devices, and for a broad diversity of users, by
          addressing matters of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, privacy, and security.

        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the WebApps Working Group is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Haptic input devices and their emitted events and/or data.
          </li>
          <li>Data sharing across remote and local web applications.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving and acting upon data from remote sources.
          </li>
          <li>Accessing the file system and persistent storage.
          </li>
          <li>Interfacing with OS capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Integrating web applications with the OS.
          </li>
          <li>Preventing the screen from turning off under certain conditions.
          </li>
          <li>Providing location information, either of the hosting device or a location selected by the user.
          </li>
          <li>Providing information about changes in motion and orientation of the hosting device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Working Group will not adopt new proposals until they have matured through the <a href="https://wicg.io/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> or a similar incubation phase.
          If the Working Group decides to add new Recommendation-track deliverables
          then it will recharter with changes to change its deliverables.</p>

                contexts where an HTMLImageElement is not suitable or available
                (e.g., in a Worker).

                <p>The core of this specification is a worker that wakes to receive events. This provides an event destination that can be used when other destinations would be inappropriate, or no other destination exists.</p>

                <p>For example, to allow the developer to decide how a page should be fetched, an event needs to dispatch potentially before any other execution contexts exist for that origin. To react to a push message, or completion of a persistent download, the context that originally registered interest may no longer exist. In these cases, the service worker is the ideal event destination.</p>

                <p>This specification also provides a fetch event, and a request and response store similar in design to the HTTP cache, which makes it easier to build offline-enabled web applications.</p>

            All specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group are
            expected to progress during this charter period. The charter does
            not include a detailed timeline for each specification because such

    <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
    <p>In order to advance beyond
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
        implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance beyond
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
    <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>Each specification must have an accompanying test suite, which is
    ideally developed in parallel to the specification. The test suite
    will be used to produce an implementation report before the
    specification advances beyond <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
    <p>
    Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles</a>.
    </p>

  </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p>
          The Chairs and Editors will assess support from web platform
          implementers or web application or framework developers to ensure that
          substantial changes are supported by more than a single member before
          adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, at least two web platform implementers must support a
          substantive change before it can be made to a specification. This is
          enforced by a pull request template on GitHub, which Editors must fill
          out as a public record before a substantive contribution can be
          merged. The template will require implementers to give public support
          for a change/fix/feature and, where possible, provide a link to a
          public bug tracker for an implementation.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the Web Applications Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web Applications Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-webapps@w3.org">public-webapps@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/">archive</a>), and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/webappswg#specifications">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

            History of this WG

          <p>
            The WebApps Working Group was a predecessor to the <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a>
            (which remains active to work on specifications that are pertinent
            to the discussions relating to a collaboration agreement between
            the W3C and the WHATWG). The remaining specifications have been
            transferred from the Web Platform Working Group to the WebApps
            Working Group, so that progress can continue to be made on those
            specifications while the W3C and WHATWG negotiations are ongoing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, specifications that have been successfully incubated
            in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform
            Incubator Community Group (WICG)</a> have been transferred to the
            WebApps Working Group.

              <p>This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data. This includes:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 <p>A <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-filelist" id="ref-for-dfn-filelist">FileList</a></code> interface, which represents an array of individually selected files from the underlying system. The user interface for selection can be invoked via <code>&lt;input type="file"></code>, i.e. when the input element is in the <code>File Upload</code> state <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#biblio-html" title="HTML Standard">[HTML]</a>.</p>
                <li data-md>
                 <p>A <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob" id="ref-for-dfn-Blob">Blob</a></code> interface, which represents immutable raw binary data, and allows access to ranges of bytes within the <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob" id="ref-for-dfn-Blob①">Blob</a></code> object as a separate <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob" id="ref-for-dfn-Blob②">Blob</a></code>.</p>
                <li data-md>
                 <p>A <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-file" id="ref-for-dfn-file">File</a></code> interface, which includes readonly informational attributes about a file such as its name and the date of the last modification (on disk) of the file.</p>
                <li data-md>
                 <p>A <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-filereader" id="ref-for-dfn-filereader">FileReader</a></code> interface, which provides methods to read a <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-file" id="ref-for-dfn-file①">File</a></code> or a <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob" id="ref-for-dfn-Blob③">Blob</a></code>, and an event model to obtain the results of these reads.</p>
                <li data-md>
                 <p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#url">URL scheme</a> for use with binary data such as files, so that they can be referenced within web applications.</p>
               </ul>
               <p>Additionally, this specification defines objects to be used within threaded web applications for the synchronous reading of files.</p>
               <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#requirements">§ 10 Requirements and Use Cases</a> covers the motivation behind this specification.</p>
               <p>This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#xmlhttprequest" id="ref-for-xmlhttprequest">XMLHttpRequest</a></code> (e.g. with an overloaded <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-xmlhttprequest-send" id="ref-for-dom-xmlhttprequest-send">send()</a></code> method for <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-file" id="ref-for-dfn-file②">File</a></code> or <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob" id="ref-for-dfn-Blob④">Blob</a></code> arguments), <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-worker-postmessage-options" id="ref-for-dom-worker-postmessage-options">postMessage()</a></code>, <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#datatransfer" id="ref-for-datatransfer">DataTransfer</a></code> (part of the drag and drop API defined in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#biblio-html" title="HTML Standard">[HTML]</a>)
              and Web Workers.
              Additionally, it should be possible to programmatically obtain a list of files from the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element" id="ref-for-the-input-element">input</a></code> element
              when it is in the <code>File Upload</code> state <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#biblio-html" title="HTML Standard">[HTML]</a>.
              These kinds of behaviors are defined in the appropriate affiliated specifications.</p>

              <p>This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent B-tree data structure.</p>

              The <cite>Screen Orientation</cite> specification standardizes the
              types and angles for a device's screen orientation, and provides a
              means for locking and unlocking it. The API, defined by this
              specification, exposes the current type and angle of the device's
              screen orientation, and dispatches events when it changes. This enables
              web applications to programmatically adapt the user experience for
              multiple screen orientations, working alongside CSS. The API also
              allows for the screen orientation to be locked under certain
              preconditions. This is particularly useful for applications such as
              computer games, where users physically rotate the device, but the
              screen orientation itself should not change.

              <p>This specification defines a JSON-based file format that provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application. This metadata includes, but is not limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers to declare a default screen orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the manifest is applied and provides a means to "deep link" into a web application from other applications.</p>

              <p>Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application.</p>
